# minimal-react-boilerplate

Because sometimes you don't need that much

## Why?

I was kinda tired of using boilerplates / front-end generation tools with a lot of useless <sub><sup>(for my tasks)</sup></sub> crap or that didn't fit my needs at all, so I created my own.

## Features

- React
- Folder aliases
- SASS
- normalize.css

## Scripts

For developing:

```Bash
yarn run dev
```

For building:
```Bash
yarn run build
```
